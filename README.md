# percentage-and-grade-calculator
A simple percentage and grade calculating software. 

This software is intended to help python learners starting up with very-very simple python project based on python data structures, loops, functions and basic methods. I will feel happy if this piece of code helped any python learner with an idea to create a simple project.

It works with concept:  It takes input of your obtained marks for  8 different subjects(based on curriculum of class-10 of nepal). Then if all those subjects have common full marks you can simply input that common full mark, else you have to type full marks for each and every subject . In this way, percentage can be easily calculated dividing total obtained marks by total full marks.

For grading system , the process is kinda lengthy: Firstly, the software converts the obtained marks into 100 based on its full marks. Then it compares your obtained  marks(which have been converted into 100) for each subjects, and assign grade points for each subjects too. Then after assigning grade points of each subjects , it averages that grade point into Grade Point Average(GPA) and compares within range of (0-4) and assign respective Letter Grade within particular range. In this way, you can get your grades checked.
